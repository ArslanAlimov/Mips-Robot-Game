For this project, you are given a program that implements a game where a human user tries to escape from four robots. The user and four robots are on an x-y grid. On every step, you enter a move for the human. The robots will attempt to get closer to the human.
When a robot has the same x-y coordinates as the human, the game is over. You will translate this program faithfully, following all function call guidelines and MIPS register use conventions.
